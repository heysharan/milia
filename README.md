## Overview

The project implementation is started by AJ Works on Jan 27 2025.

The project will consist of requirements gathering phase, and documenting it in the form of user guide as well as specification for the developers. After getting the consent from all the people involved - project implementation team and users, the implementation phase starts which should be completed in 20% time of the total time spent in requirements gathering and implementation.

More about the requirements gathering phase, the functional documentation with required screenshots will be managed on Github Wiki and it will have URLs. This content will be public and accessible to end users. This will also prove as user guide for end users. The technical documentation will be managed on project's private Github repository and will include class, DFD, and flow diagrams related to each function.

The implementation phase includes configuration, customization, and testing. The testing should include the unit testing cases developed in custom modules which will directly help in validating UATs (User Acceptance Testing).
