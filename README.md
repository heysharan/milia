## **ERP Implementation – Odoo 18.0**

---

## **Overview**

This project will be executed in two primary phases:

1. **Requirements & Design**
2. **Implementation & Testing**

The approach emphasizes documentation-first development, stakeholder alignment, and test-driven customization to ensure a stable, scalable, and maintainable ERP implementation using **Odoo 18.0**.

---

## **1. Requirements & Design Phase**

The Requirements & Design phase focuses on comprehensive **requirements gathering** from all relevant stakeholders, including business users and the project implementation team. The primary objective is to gain a deep understanding of business processes, system expectations, and functional gaps.

### **Deliverables**

#### **Functional Documentation**
- Detailed business process descriptions, workflows, and expected system behavior.
- Supported with relevant screenshots and usage examples.
- Maintained on **GitHub Wiki** with structured pages and permanent URLs.
- Publicly accessible and intended to serve as:
  - A **functional specification** for the implementation team.
  - A **user guide** for end users.

#### **Technical Documentation**
- Maintained in the project’s **private GitHub repository**.
- Includes:
  - Class diagrams
  - Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
  - Process flow diagrams
  - System and module architecture diagrams
- Provides clear technical specifications for developers to implement, customize, and extend the system accurately.

### **Approval Gate**

The Requirements & Design phase concludes only after **formal review and approval** from all relevant stakeholders, ensuring complete alignment before development begins.

---

## **2. Implementation & Testing Phase**

Upon approval of the documented requirements, the project transitions into the **Implementation Phase**, which includes configuration, customization, and validation.

### **Scope**

#### **System Configuration**
- Standard Odoo configurations aligned with approved and documented business workflows.

#### **Customization & Development**
- Development of custom modules and features as defined in the approved functional and technical specifications.

#### **Testing & Validation**
- Unit test cases implemented within custom modules.
- Unit tests designed to directly support and streamline **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**.
- Early validation of business scenarios to minimize defects and rework during UAT.

### **Time Allocation Principle**

The **implementation effort** is planned to be completed within **20% of the total time spent across both the Requirements & Design and Implementation phases**, highlighting the importance of thorough upfront analysis, documentation, and validation.
